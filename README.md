Basic Two-Sample Tests In Python
This repository provides Python code snippets and explanations for various statistical tests and analyses commonly used in data science and research. Each section focuses on a specific statistical test, including implementation details, interpretation of results, and visualizations where applicable.

Two Independent Samples t-test
The two independent samples t-test is utilized to compare the means of two independent groups and assess whether they are significantly different. This test is suitable when comparing two distinct samples, such as male versus female students' exam scores. The code snippet demonstrates how to conduct a two-sample t-test using both SciPy and Researchpy libraries, along with interpreting the results and visualizing the data.

Paired Sample T-test
The paired sample t-test examines the mean difference between two related groups, typically before and after an intervention. This test evaluates whether the intervention has had a significant effect on the measured outcome. The repository includes code examples using both the scipy.stats library and Researchpy for conducting and interpreting paired sample t-tests.

Welchâ€™s Test
Welch's t-test is employed when comparing the means of two independent groups with potentially unequal variances. It is a robust alternative to the traditional t-test when the assumption of equal variances is violated. The GitHub repository illustrates how to perform Welch's t-test using Python and provides insights into interpreting the results.

Mann-Whitney U Test
The Mann-Whitney U test, also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, is a non-parametric test for assessing differences between two independent groups. It is employed when the assumptions of normality and equal variances are not met. The repository offers code snippets for conducting the Mann-Whitney U test and interpreting the results, along with visualizations for data comparison.

Chi-square Test
The chi-square test is used to determine the association between two categorical variables and assess whether they are independent or dependent. It is applicable when analyzing contingency tables with categorical data. The GitHub repository includes code examples for performing chi-square tests and visualizing contingency tables to aid in result interpretation.

Fisher's Exact Test
Fisher's exact test is a statistical test used to analyze contingency tables with small sample sizes (specifically 2x2 tables). It assesses the association between two categorical variables and provides insights into whether they are dependent or independent. The repository demonstrates how to conduct Fisher's exact test in Python and interpret the results effectively.

Each section in the repository provides detailed explanations, code snippets, and interpretations for the respective statistical tests, enabling users to apply these methods effectively in their data analysis projects and research endeavors. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this repository serves as a valuable resource for statistical analysis in Python.
